2014 is almost over (about a month more to go), and I am very proud of my contributions on #github. I assume they will grow some more as I plan to increase my projects and web development experience. Waiting for the right gig is not working for me anymore. The plan is to #read more and work on more short term projects (more weekend hackathons-like project idea). Hopefully with the arrival of my very own mac - ikr :) - will increase my productivity.

I admit this graph is not as impressive as others. In my defense, my previous year had worse contribution stats. I have learned so much during this year that I can almost guarantee that my graph will be much more colourful by the end of the year 2015. 

Wish me luck. Happy new year! <br />
Cheers to the #2015
