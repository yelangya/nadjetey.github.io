Welcome to my blog now using the new [Wangana theme](https://github.com/nadjetey/wangana) developed by [Nii](https://twitter.com/_nadjetey) for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) - the static site generator written in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).

I have tried jekyll theme development a few times before. Here are the links to those projects, if you are interested:

 + [Redcup](https://github.com/nadjetey/redcup)
 + [Shotgun](https://github.com/nadjetey/Shotgun)
 + [Sunray](https://github.com/nadjetey/sunray)

I made a personal commitment to take this theme as far as I possibly can, instead of taking the easy route and starting another one from scratch. I like to think of this project as organic -- as I learn more about Jekyll & Ruby, I will refactor my knowledge into improving this theme.

However, I am always happy to get help from you. Fork this theme and personalize it as much as you want. If there is a change you would like, implement and make a pull request.

Go open-source!
