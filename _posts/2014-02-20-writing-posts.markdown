After following the format outlined in the Jekyll [documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/), you are almost ready to start blogging with [Wangana theme](https://github.com/nadjetey/wangana).

The only thing specific to Wangana is the comments option, which you have to set in [front matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) of the post. Set the comments option to true or false, depending on your preference like this:

    ---
    comments: true
