In my opinion, one of the most obstructive stumbling blocks hindering the success of Ghanaian tech businesses is remuneration (money). By “tech businesses”, I mean young developers trying to be entrepreneurial in selling their skills/services/tech products. Apart from the fact that most developers will sell themselves short by settling for significantly cheaper rates, it is very common for clients to renege on payment agreements.

Almost all of my developer friends have a story like this; a client agrees with a developer (dev) to pay say 50% of an agreed charge before contracted job and another 50% after completion. After job is completed and delivered, the latter 50% charge is not honored by the client. At this point, the dev is faced with a decision as to how to settle this issue. Suing is out of the question – it is expensive and time consuming, not to even mention the frustrations involved. Other options include following up with phone calls, in-person chats and other amicable resolutions (that is, if the client doesn’t play the cat and mouse game with you). The last option is to somehow take down the site or refuse public access (that is, if this option actually applies to the situation)


### My understanding of what the problem is in bullet points:

+ Following legal resolution is not a very enticing option for devs given the circumstances
+ Clients cannot trust devs to deliver if given full payment before hand
+ Devs cannot trust clients to give full payment after job completion and delivery
+ There is no realistic way to guarantee trust from both parties (not yet anyway)

### The proposed solution:

I believe both parties trust the banks and therefore the banks may be used as the ‘middle man’ to guarantee client and dev satisfaction. Currently, I am not aware of any such bank service but if there was such a thing, I am sure this will solve the problem. Imagine a situation where, after the client and dev have agreed on the terms of agreement, the bank is used as a third party. The client per the terms of the contract will provide full payment for the job and produce a ticket of some sort, which the dev will use to collect payment at delivery dates. The bank through this suggested service will ensure that the dev is paid for work done hence restoring ‘trust’ in this terrain. I know this idea can be better refined by the bankers (it is their job after all)

Just imagine the possibilities, the opportunities something like this will create. I believe this idea has the potential to help techies build mind blowing businesses. I believe this idea has the potential to lower the much talked about graduate unemployment and inadvertently lower poverty.
