I Nii, have fallen in love with the Rails framework and community. After reading @richardsondx article, ["How I TRAINed to learn Rails (A Guide to Learning Rails in 2 months)"](https://medium.com/how-i-learned-ruby-rails/e08c94e2a51e), I was inspired! No more games, it's time to up my skills. I got myself a copy of ["Agile Web Development with Rails, Edition 4"](http://pragprog.com/book/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails-4) and started to study/read.

Previously, I had installed rails but the books perspective was on versions: rails 3.0, ruby 1.9.2, and gem 1.3.7 (those were the current versions available at the time the book was written) Initially I could not tell that this could be a problem. The versions installed on my PC were: rails 4.1.1, ruby 2.1, and gem 2.2.2, I don't know why I thought I could follow along with the demo example illustrated in the book.

After struggling with the examples because of the version difference, I turned to the Internet to look for updates to the book. Even though I eventually solved most of my problems, this shrank the fun. I did not find what I was looking for, I found something even better - I found a site with the examples re-adjusted to meet the current versions I was using! [This legit site ](http://intertwingly.net/projects/AWDwR4/checkdepot-210-41/) promises to restore the joy of learning for me.

## New plan
The updated plan is to continue to read the book but use the site for the examples. I will restart the demo, and this time I intend to keep track of the time I spend with the gem [timetrap](http://rubygems.org/gems/timetrap)

### At the end of this experiment, I will:
+ Have learned some valuable Rails tricks
+ Have grounded myself in the framework and the community practices
+ Have provided how long it took me to complete the book & demo
+ Have built the courage to try new Rails projects
+ Have completed my first book and ready to move to the next book on Rails
+ Have successfully provided documented proof of my journey to becoming a Senior Ruby on Rails Developer

More Vimm!
