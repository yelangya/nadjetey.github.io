The main objective of this application is to make the 'red carpet photoshoot' experience easy to setup and host. For example, at an event there is a 'app_idea_001' photo booth setup outside by the entrance. On the set there is a scene with the focus posing. The focus possesses and handles the trigger/remote to take the shot. A tv/projector is stationed directly across from the focus & scenery to aid in picture capturing process. When the focus is satisfied with the picture set, the shot taken via the trigger/remote. The focus may choose to visit the photo booth server name (pbsn) and invite themselves and or others to the gallery blast.

###\shoot downs
Why would the photographers (which is one of the main market targets) use the application since it takes away from their creativity? This application doesnâ€™t allow the photographers to fully utilise their creative & professional ideas - the power is put in the hands of the focus.
