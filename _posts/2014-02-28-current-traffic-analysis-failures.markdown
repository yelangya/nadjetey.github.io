This was the welcome notice I received while trying to view the traffic to my GitHub repositories using [bitdeli](http://blog.bitdeli.com/post/77717727361/on-githubs-image-proxy). The most bitdeli could do was post this on their site: 
> There doesn’t seem to be an easy way to fix the problem on our side.

On the bright side, Github is actually giving you by default all the traffic analysis features - get this - for free! It was part of a system wide upgrade, so all you have to do is 

+ click on the `contributor` link right under the description of your repo
+ then finally click on the `traffic` tab

on your own GitHub account for traffic monitoring and analysis.
