"Service disruption: GitHub has recently changed the way images are served in readmes. This has seriously limited our traffic analytics features for repositories. Read more"

This was the welcome notice I received while trying to view the traffic to my GitHub repositories using [bitdeli](http://blog.bitdeli.com/post/77717727361/on-githubs-image-proxy). The most bitdeli could do was post this on their site:
> There doesnâ€™t seem to be an easy way to fix the problem on our side.

On the bright side, Github is actually giving you by default all the traffic analysis features - get this - for free! It was part of a system wide upgrade, so all you have to do is

+ click on the `contributor` link right under the description of your repo
+ then finally click on the `traffic` tab

on your own GitHub account for traffic monitoring and analysis.
