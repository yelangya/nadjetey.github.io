It is common knowledge that programmers/coders/developers/codewriters resident in Africa are not easily visible online. Scott Hanselman referred to them as [dark matter developers](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DarkMatterDevelopersTheUnseen99.aspx). I do not fully understand exactly why this is the case but I definitely want to contribute to changing it.

My team is proud to present to you [afridevcmty](http://afridevcmty.herokuapp.com/)(version 0.1) This is an online directory of African programmers. A place where anyone can search programmers based on  country (African countries only), programming language and African region. The benefits of [afridevcmty](http://afridevcmty.herokuapp.com/) include:

* developers in Africa can find partners (who understand the context) to work with
* the world can see the work of developers from Africa
* it offers an aggregated list of coders resident in Africa (along with other information like their language of choice, blogs etc)

Based on research, there are other platforms that have tried to tackle this issue. But these platforms have one thing in common – they require users to signin or signup (the failure of these platforms have been attributed to this problem). That's where our project stands out.  There is no signup or signin required. All users are pulled from [Github](https://github.com/)
_[afridevcmty](http://afridevcmty.herokuapp.com/) relies on  [github](https://github.com/)_

Note: Only users with github accounts that were created before 19 July 2014 and with location fields which are not empty are present in the directory.

### How to use
<iframe src="//instagram.com/p/qrfzMWoqgG/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

Visit [afridevcmty.herokuapp.com](http://afridevcmty.herokuapp.com/)
If your github account is not listed but fit the profile then it might be because:

* the account that was created after 19 July 2014 or
* the location field in your github user account profile is empty

_if these requirements are fulfilled and still cannot see the profile in afridevcmty, a feature for adding new accounts will be developed very soon_
